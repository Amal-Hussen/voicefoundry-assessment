# voicefoundry-assessment
The VoiceFoundry Vanity phone challenge.

1. Record your reasons for implementing the solution the way you did, struggles you faced and problems you overcame.

During the course of completing this challenge, I familiarised myself with AWS services like AWS Connect, AWS Lambda and AWS DynamDB. I spent time watching tutorials and reading documentation to become better informed with these services and how they work and the purpose of their functions. In my code I identified the 'best' numbers as numbers that had the most English characters in them.

2. What shortcuts did you take that would be bad practise in production?

A shortcut I took during this challenge was pushing the project onto GitHub as opposed to deploying on AWS. I would like to learn in future how to deploy changes like these on AWS.
3. What would you have done with more time?

With more time, I would have like to test this function out and attempted to save the vanity numbers on another AWS service like Simple Storage Service. I would have also enjoyed making my contact flow as it seems interesting.
